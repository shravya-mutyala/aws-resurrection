## 📝 Key Concepts

### The Resurrection Process
1. User enters dead URL
2. Backend queries Wayback Machine
3. Historical snapshots retrieved
4. AI reconstructs missing content
5. Ghost personality generated
6. User can chat with the ghost

**Detailed Flow**: See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)

### The Gothic Archaeologist Persona
- Mystical yet technical language
- Reverent treatment of dead sites
- Atmospheric, spooky tone
- Consistent throughout UI

**Full Guidelines**: See `.kiro/steering/gothic_archeologist.md`

### Kiro Integration
- **Vibe Coding**: Natural language → code
- **Spec-Driven**: YAML → architecture
- **Steering**: Consistent AI guidance
- **Hooks**: Automated workflows
- **MCP**: Custom tool integration

**Deep Dive**: See [HACKATHON_DEMO.md](HACKATHON_DEMO.md) Kiro section
